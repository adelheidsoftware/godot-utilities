# Godot Scripting Utilities

This repository contains various pieces of code, often with example usage, that one might reasonably want to use in the course of creating a game with Godot. We think it's beneficial to everyone to share these things freely with the community, so feel free to use this code for anything you like!

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute code of your own that you feel others might find useful, feel free to make a pull request. Note that this means releasing that code under the repository's license, and acknowledging that you have the rights to release the code under said license.

## Code Style

All samples in this repository that use GDScript are fully typed and obey these patterns:
* Class names: PascalCase
* Variable names: snake_case
* Function names: snake_case

For C# code, we generally stick with Java-style naming conventions, rather than C# naming conventions.
